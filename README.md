# Shortest Path Attempt (june 2025)
python code that finds the shortest/lightest path between two points on a randomly generated graph
i coded this instead of sleeping

this code is horrible please look at my newer works

like i didn't even realize that dijkstra invented the solution not the problem, therefore it is inaccurate to say this program uses the dijsktra algorithm, but it was fun to make my own algorithm
